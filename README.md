# Transcoder
Custom transcoder based of [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) written in
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Back-end) and [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (Front-end)

# Installation
## Installing
1. Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Click download this github repo
3. Run main.ahk

## Notes
- Currently you need to download both [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). This will be changed in later builds but as of right now it will not
## Troubleshooting
1. If there is any problem, click debug.ahk and select the same file
2. After a few seconds it should open a small small console with a errorcode.
3. copy that and make a new [issue](https://github.com/MierenManz/ahktrans/issues/new)
4. Paste the copied error in the issue and then submit it.
5. Wait a few days and a new version will be released
